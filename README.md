# OpenSceneGraph
A Hello World Program in OSG an Open Source Project!
As we use in google.earth we use the technique of image cutting.

Like cutting down the images in several small images.

This is a Hello world program for OSG Earth Project.

We use the CMake to build this project every part of this project is open source and free to use.

Many big organisatio used these CMake files to build their product available to fast and secure.
